VoiceAgent and FaceAgent - To Do Lists

VoiceAgent
- [ ] Manage ElevenLabs API keys via GCP Secret Manager
- [ ] Implement voice cloning pipeline (upload, validate test phrase, duration checks)
- [ ] Add quality checks (SNR, clipping, background noise); reject poor samples
- [ ] Run cloning/synthesis as background jobs with retries/backoff and idempotency
- [ ] Store voice profiles per person; link to DB person/user; add indexes
- [ ] Expose per-person voice settings (stability, similarity); defaults and validation
- [ ] Move raw and processed audio to GCS; serve via signed URLs
- [ ] Add endpoints: create/list/update/delete voice profiles; secure and rate-limited
- [ ] Add caching (Redis) for read-heavy voice profile fetches
- [ ] Structured JSON logs with request IDs; trace external calls to ElevenLabs
- [ ] Add upload CAPTCHA and stricter CORS; set HSTS and security headers
- [ ] Integration tests for uploads, cloning jobs, error cases and rate limits
- [ ] Define retention policy for raw recordings; backups and PITR for DB

FaceAgent
- [ ] Implement face capture/upload flow with clear permission and progress states (mobile-first)
- [ ] Validate inputs server-side (schema validation) and add per-route rate limits
- [ ] Add face quality gates (sharpness/blur, lighting, face coverage, multiple faces)
- [ ] Train per-person face representation/model; persist metadata and versions
- [ ] Implement face swap/generation pipeline with GPU support; progress & cancel
- [ ] Store training data and artifacts in GCS with signed URLs
- [ ] Background jobs for training/inference; retries/backoff; idempotent operations
- [ ] Observability: JSON logs, request IDs, traces around heavy GPU steps
- [ ] Security: stricter headers, CORS; audit log for sensitive actions
- [ ] Tests: unit + integration for uploads, training, inference, and QC
- [ ] Data lifecycle: retention for raw face data; compliant deletion on request

Cross-Cutting
- [ ] CDN for static/media delivery to reduce latency and cost
- [ ] Dashboards/alerts in Cloud Logging; error budgets and SLOs
